    <p> <h4> I am a 3rd year CTD major from Sammamish, WA. I have a passion for photography
        and special effects. I am a snowboarder and mountain biker, and am super excited
        to continue to explore Colorado!</h4>

    <p> <h4>My goals for this course are to get familiar with HTML and with basic web design, as 
        I would like to code and own my own website and not have to rely on something
        like WIX or some other website builder.</h4>
