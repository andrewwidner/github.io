    <p><center>Combustion engines require air in order for fuel to burn within the pistons. Ever wonder how many different ways you could make that happen? </center> </p>
    <p> <center>As such, combustion engines require air in order for the combustion cylce to work. But, there are a variety of ways that engines can deliver this air to the system, and benefits / drawbacks to each method</center></p>

    <center> An internal combustion engine (ICE or IC engine) is a heat engine in which the combustion of a fuel occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber that is an integral part of the working fluid flow circuit. In an internal combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion applies direct force to some component of the engine. The force is typically applied to pistons (piston engine), turbine blades (gas turbine), a rotor (Wankel engine), or a nozzle (jet engine). This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into kinetic energy which is used to propel, move or power whatever the engine is attached to.

    <h2><center>Natural aspiration</center></h2>
    
    <p>
    
    <center> In a naturally aspirated engine, air for combustion (Diesel cycle in a diesel engine or specific types of Otto cycle in petrol engines, namely petrol direct injection) or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines), is drawn into the engine's cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward bottom dead centre during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's inlet tract, which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percentâ€”and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, in addition to being influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter of which decreases as the operating altitude increases.

 <section> <div id="Turbochargers">

    <h2><center>Turbochargers</center></h2>
    
    <p>
    
    <center> In an internal combustion engine, a turbocharger (also known as a turbo or a turbosupercharger) is a forced induction device that is powered by the flow of exhaust gases. It uses this energy to compress the intake air, forcing more air into the engine in order to produce more power for a given displacement. In essence, a turbocharger works as a spool, building speed as the car exausts more air through RPMs. This menas that Turbochargers deliver a much higher amount of pressure as RPMs are higher, and a much smaller amount of pressure near low RPMs.

 <section><div id="Superchargers">

    <h2><center>Superchargers</center></h2>
    
    <p>
    
    <center> In an internal combustion engine, a supercharger compresses the intake gas, forcing more air into the engine in order to produce more power for a given displacement.

        The current categorisation is that a supercharger is a form of forced induction that is mechanically powered (usually by a belt from the engine's crankshaft), as opposed to a turbocharger, which is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases. However, up until the mid-20th century, a turbocharger was called a "turbosupercharger" and was considered a type of supercharger.

<section> <div id="Carburetors"> 
    <h2><center>Carburetors</center></h2>
    <p>
    <center> A carburetor (also spelled carburettor or carburetter) is a device used by a gasoline internal combustion engine to control and mix air and fuel entering the engine. The primary method of adding fuel to the intake air is through the Venturi tube in the main metering circuit, though various other components are also used to provide extra fuel or air in specific circumstances.

        Since the 1990s, carburetors have been largely replaced by fuel injection for cars and trucks, but carburetors are still used by some small engines (e.g. lawnmowers, generators, and concrete mixers) and motorcycles. In addition, they are still widely used on piston engine driven aircraft. Diesel engines have always used fuel injection instead of carburetors.

        <p> While many of these aspiration types were developed in the early 20th century, using them proved difficult as engines were still prone to damage from such high pressure. Cars like produced by the Climber Motor Company from Little Rock, AK, certainly wouldn't have been able to hold up to a supercharger.
